[Find recording here](18.03.2024.m4a)

- Create a newsletter and send it out to our contacts to retain their interest (Farhanah)
- Recruitment of admins and marketers (Jo)
- Create a simple informational website for https://www.palcollective.com:
    - Using GitHub pages for simplicity (Orwa)
    - Content incudes _what is PalCollective_, vision, motivation and approach (Tyle)
- We decided to take a _Top-Down Approach_[^1] to our MVP:
    - Some ideas on what to use for relaying texts, creating something like a call-center-style operation (Janine)
    - Some ideas on what back-office corporate tools to use, by those taking calls or handling humanitarian leads (Orwa,
      looking into odoo)
- Even with the above, we might still need to develop some parts (unclear at this point)
- Safety framework needs to adapt to this new innovation strategy (Katie), how can we avoid leaking personal information
  when the goal is to connect people together.
- Can we use neural networks and open-source software to detect leakage of personal information? (Maybe Carles?)
- Investigate how we can create partnerships to supply:
    - People answering calls (acting as pals) (Farhanah)
    - People helping on the ground in Gaza (Farhanah) 

[^1]: A _top-down innovation strategy_ in software relies on re-purposing existing software for everything but
the most unique aspects of our development, for which custom software can be developed. The parts coded from
scratch are also sometimes called, the _bottom-up parts_, to mean just that. (is this clear?)
